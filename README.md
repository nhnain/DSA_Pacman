# Data Structures and Algorithms - Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementations for the final project of the course Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented mainly in **Javascript**. The focus is on understanding the key concepts from the course, their time complexities, and applying them to solve practical problems. Especially in this project, I apply the use of array for creating map, queue and set as well as BFS algorithm to search for ghosts' movements 

## Project structure
game.js: the main game loop and overall game management
pacman.js: defining the Pacman class and its behaviors
ghost.js: the Ghost class with pathfinding logic
animations.gif: assets for Pacman’s animation frames and ghost.png for ghost images
index.html: setting up the game canvas and load necessary scripts
style.css: defining the game’s visual styles

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nhnain/DSA_Pacman.git
   ```
2. Start live server:
  Right click to the file **pacman.html** and choose **Open with live server**
  If you have not installed Live Server yet, please download it in the extension before running the code if you are using VSCode
